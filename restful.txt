RESTful:Representational state of on object(sent in JSON or XML format)

HTTP GET
HTTP POST
HTTP PUT
HTTP DELETE
HTTP PATCH

REST APIs enable you to develop any kind of web application having all
possible CRUD (create(POST), retrieve(GET), update(PUT), delete(DELETE)) operations.

Always use PUT for UPDATE operation(idempotent : retry request multiple time
       is equivalent to single request modification), 
Always use POST for CREATE(new) operation most as to add child resource(add a new device)

GET 	/device-management/devices : Get all devices
POST 	/device-management/devices : Create a new device

GET 	/device-management/devices/{id} : Get the device information identified by "id"
PUT 	/device-management/devices/{id} : Update the device information identified by "id"
DELETE	/device-management/devices/{id} : Delete device by "id"


TOMCAT: HTTP server and servelet container
NGNX:   HTTP server plus more
JERRY is also another HTTP server, 
app-server vs webserver
JBOSS:

JSON : Java script object notation: replaces XML based usage.
JSON has its own specification format, 


docker: 
kubernteis:
kubectl: command line tool, CLI,
uses docker host to host container.

API Server: Frontend
etcd: Keyvalue store, lock 
kubelet: Agent runs on each cluster.
scheduler: distributing work across nodes.
Container Runtime: Docker

containers : Completely isolated system, while sharing
same OS kernel. Meaning containers can run various different 
Linux flavors, while having a kernel which is linux.
Meaning, containers can't run windows OS, or macOS while its 
using Linux kernel underneath.
Main purpuose of container is to containerize an application and ship them.

virtual-machine. VM's have an OS inside it.
Type-1(run on baremetal) hypervisor(e.g ESXi):
     Helps Virtualize H/W and run an OS on a virtual-machine.
Container  is not virtual-machine.

e.g how docker creates a container from  already pre created docker image.
docker run ansible
docker run mongodb
docker run redis,

container vs image:
containers are running instances of image.
image is a file
