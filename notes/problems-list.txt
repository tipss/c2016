 2) how will you search a sequence of bits over array of bytes
 
 3) Design Qs: You have an incoming stream of bits. You have infinite memory, 
    processing power. Design a system that will check for viruses. 
    You have all the viruses signatures.
    
 4) Same qs, You have limited processing power. How would you do?
 
 5) When do you use Red Black tree, Avl tree
 
 6) swap the nibbles in a byte. 0101 0001 -> 0001 0101
 
 7) some pointer output qs.
 -> void *p=0; p+=2; printf(“%d”,*p);
 -> int **p=0; printf(“%d”,**p);

 8) count the number of set bits in a byte( in the best possible way)
 
 9) What packets are generated when a networking device tries to reach another 
    networking device in a different network , connected through intermediate two routers. 
    Explain in detail
