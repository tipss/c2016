High-Level Functionality
GDB enables source-level debugging by interacting with:

The program being debugged (called the inferior)

The OS kernel (via ptrace() syscall on Linux)

Symbol/debug info from the compiled binary (like DWARF)

‚öôÔ∏è How GDB Works Internally
Component	Function
ptrace() syscall	Core interface GDB uses to pause/resume the target process, read/write memory, set breakpoints
DWARF / symbol tables	Used to map binary instructions to source code, function names, line numbers, variables
Breakpoints	GDB inserts INT 3 (0xCC) instruction to pause execution at a given address
Watchpoints	GDB uses hardware debug registers (if available) or software checks to pause on memory changes
Stack inspection	GDB walks the call stack and reads local variables using frame pointers and debug info


===========

The Next-Hop Is Scoped to the Incoming Interface
üéØ Key point:
The link-local next-hop is always associated with the BGP session/interface that the update was received on.

Routers do not rely solely on the IP address. Instead, they track both:

the next-hop address (e.g., fe80::1)

the interface (or peer) from which the BGP UPDATE was rece	ived

This is sometimes called the "next-hop interface binding".


Two BGP peers:
Peer A on eth0: sends route to 2001:db8::/64 with next-hop fe80::1

Peer B on eth1: sends route to 2001:db9::/64 with next-hop fe80::1

Router learns:
ip -6 route
2001:db8::/64 via fe80::1 dev eth0
2001:db9::/64 via fe80::1 dev eth1
When packet matches 2001:db9::/64, it uses eth1 to reach fe80::1 (correct neighbor).


ip -6 addr show
2: eth0    inet6 fe80::1/64 scope link 
Then:
ping6 fe80::1%eth0      ‚úÖ valid
ping6 fe80::1           ‚ùå ambiguous (no interface context)


GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)	GPU	Accelerates parallel computation, graphics rendering, AI workloads. Example: NVIDIA A100, H100
CPU (Central Processing Unit)	CPU	General-purpose processor. Runs OS, applications
DPU (Data Processing Unit) ‚Äì e.g., BlueField	DPU	Offloads networking, storage, and security tasks from CPU



DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit) is a set of software libraries and drivers designed to accelerate packet processing on general-purpose CPUs, particularly in user space (bypassing the kernel). It enables applications to handle millions of packets per second, which is essential for high-performance networking.


GPUs are used in AI networks because they excel at the kind of parallel processing that modern AI workloads demand. Here's why they're essential:

üöÄ Why GPUs are Ideal for AI:
Reason	Explanation
Massive Parallelism	A GPU can have thousands of cores, making it ideal for handling matrix and vector operations used in neural networks.
High Throughput	GPUs process large blocks of data simultaneously, which is perfect for training deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, Transformers).
Optimized for Tensor Math	GPUs like NVIDIA‚Äôs A100/H100 are optimized for tensor operations (via Tensor Cores) ‚Äîz crucial for ML frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
Memory Bandwidth	AI training needs high memory bandwidth to stream data efficiently, and GPUs deliver this better than CPUs.
Framework Integration	Modern AI libraries (e.g., CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT) are GPU-accelerated, giving huge speedups out of the box.



Lossless networks are critical in AI infrastructure, especially in large-scale AI training, because they ensure efficient, high-throughput, low-latency communication across compute nodes (usually GPUs). Here's why they matter:

üí° Why Lossless Networks Are Needed for AI:
Key Reason	Why It Matters in AI
Large-scale model training	Training models like GPT or BERT often uses distributed training across many GPUs. These GPUs must exchange huge tensors (gradients) every few milliseconds.
RDMA-based communication	Protocols like NCCL over RoCEv2 or InfiniBand use RDMA to bypass the CPU and move data directly between GPU memory. RDMA demands lossless transport.
Retransmissions kill performance	In lossy networks, TCP retransmissions due to dropped packets increase latency and jitter, stalling gradient synchronization and reducing GPU utilization.
Tight synchronization	AI workloads use barrier-style synchronization (e.g., AllReduce) where one slow node slows all others. Packet loss causes head-of-line blocking and delays.


üö´ Why IP Fragmentation Is Avoided:
Routers dropping large packets leads to packet loss and performance degradation.

Fragmentation requires reassembly in IP stack, which bypasses RDMA's zero-copy benefits.

Causes issues with PFC and congestion control, making lossless delivery harder to maintain.


cket size (commonly MTU = 9000 for jumbo frames).~


üîπ What is RoCEv2?
RoCEv2 = RDMA over UDP/IP (Layer 3) + Ethernet (Layer 2).

It allows RDMA-style memory transfers over routable IP networks (vs. RoCEv1 which was Layer 2 only).

üîç Fragmentation in RoCEv2:
Type	Handled by	Notes
IP Fragmentation (by routers)	‚ùå Avoided	IP fragmentation is inefficient and discouraged. Most RoCEv2 implementations disable IP fragmentation and rely on end-to-end MTU awareness.
Application-level segmentation	‚úÖ RDMA NIC (e.g., ConnectX, BlueField)	The RNIC segments large RDMA messages into MTU-sized chunks before transmission.
RDMA Protocol (IBTA spec)	‚úÖ Handles reassembly	The RDMA transport ensures proper ordering and reassembly of data at the receiver side.
Path MTU Discovery (PMTU)	‚úÖ	Ensures all endpoints agree on max packet size (commonly MTU = 9000 for jumbo frames).



CRUD Operations in AI Networks:
Create: Adding new AI models, data, or other resources to the system.
Read: Retrieving existing AI models, data, or other resources from the system.
Update: Modifying existing AI models, data, or other resources within the system.
Delete: Removing AI models, data, or other resources from the system. 


Priority Flow Control (PFC) ‚Äî "Pause Before Drop"
‚úÖ Purpose:
Prevents packet loss at Layer 2 for RDMA traffic by pausing traffic before congestion causes drops.

üîß How It Works:
PFC operates per traffic class (CoS) via IEEE 802.1Qbb.

RoCEv2 traffic is typically marked to a specific priority (e.g., priority 3).

When a switch queue (buffer) for that priority fills up:

It sends a PFC pause frame to the upstream device.

The sender temporarily stops sending traffic on that priority class.

Only the specific class is paused ‚Äî not all traffic.

üåê In Arista EOS:
Configure QoS class maps to assign RoCEv2 packets to a specific priority.

Enable PFC on that priority.

Fine-tune buffer thresholds to avoid premature or late pauses.


 Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) ‚Äî "Mark Before Drop"
‚úÖ Purpose:
Proactively signals Layer 3 congestion to avoid packet drops and improve latency + fairness.

üîß How It Works:
ECN marks packets (IP header) when switch queue exceeds a congestion threshold.

Receiver (e.g., NIC) detects the ECN mark (CE bit) and sends a Congestion Notification Packet (CNP) to the sender.

The sender then slows down RDMA transmit rate for that flow (adaptive rate reduction).

Used in RoCEv2 with ECN-capable RNICs (e.g., NVIDIA ConnectX or BlueField).

üåê In Arista EOS:
ECN thresholds are configured per queue.

EOS monitors queue depth and marks packets accordingly.



PFC	Loss in switch buffers	RoCEv2 requires zero loss ‚Äî dropped RDMA packets can't be recovered easily.
ECN	Persistent congestion and unfairness	Prevents buffer buildup, keeps latency low, and avoids excessive pause storms.
Together, they strike a balance:

PFC: Handles transient bursts with immediate backpressure.

ECN: Manages persistent congestion by signaling flow-level rate control.

üñ• Example Flow in AI Training:
RoCEv2 packets are tagged with DSCP or CoS (e.g., priority 3).

Switch applies PFC on priority 3 ‚Äî ensures no drops in high-speed AI sync traffic.

If persistent congestion builds up:

ECN marks packets.

Receiver NIC sends CNPs.

Sender slows the rate, reducing congestion.



=============start=======
How DLB Works with RoCEv2
üîπ Inputs:
Real-time telemetry (e.g., queue depth, buffer occupancy, ECN marks, link utilization)

Flow-level traffic visibility (per-flow granularity for RDMA/NCCL)

Optionally integrates with switch ASICs supporting adaptive routing (e.g., Arista EOS over Broadcom/NVIDIA chips)

üîπ Mechanisms:
Dynamically adjust next-hop selection for flows based on congestion state

Ensure flowlet-aware balancing (tiny subflows) to avoid reordering

Works in conjunction with:

PFC: Reduce the likelihood of pause conditions

ECN: Minimize persistent congestion

üß¨ In AI Training Fabric (e.g., DGX clusters with Arista or NVIDIA Spectrum):
Layer	Component	Role
Switch	DLB logic (Arista EOS, NVIDIA Spectrum)	Detect congestion per port/queue and adjust flow path
RDMA NIC	Flow control adaptation	Reacts to ECN/CNP signals and supports reordering prevention
Network Fabric	Clos topology	Offers multiple equal-cost paths, ideal for DLB effectiveness
‚úÖ Benefits in RoCEv2 AI Workloads
Benefit	Explanation
High GPU utilization	Minimizes RDMA stalls during AllReduce or tensor sync
Low jitter + latency	Avoids congested paths proactively
Lossless efficiency	Works with PFC + ECN to stabilize the fabric
Congestion avoidance	Prevents PFC storms that can cause head-of-line blocking
üß™ Summary:
DLB is a fabric-aware, congestion-sensitive flow routing mechanism that significantly enhances RoCEv2 performance in AI/ML clusters. It's key for maintaining GPU efficiency and stable lossless transport during large-scale training jobs.

Would you like to see how Arista or NVIDIA switches implement DLB (e.g., with adaptive routing or telemetry APIs), or how it's configured in a Clos fabric?







You said:
Can PFC and ECN suffice ? why we need DLB


ChatGPT said:
Excellent follow-up ‚Äî and very relevant in AI RoCEv2 fabrics where ultra-low latency, fairness, and GPU utilization are non-negotiable.

Let‚Äôs break it down:

üß© Can PFC and ECN Alone Suffice?
‚úÖ They are necessary, but not sufficient.
Mechanism	Role	Limitation
PFC (Priority Flow Control)	Pauses traffic per-priority to prevent loss in switch queues	Can cause head-of-line blocking and pause storms if upstream is also congested
ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)	Marks packets instead of dropping them to trigger rate reduction at the source	Reactive; by the time ECN kicks in, congestion has already occurred
üö´ What Happens Without DLB?
Problem	Impact
ECMP hash collisions	Multiple heavy RDMA flows may be hashed to a single congested link, even though other paths are idle
Static flow-to-path binding	Traffic is pinned and doesn‚Äôt move even if congestion changes dynamically
Microbursts	Bursty RDMA flows (like AllReduce) may overload a path suddenly ‚Äî ECN and PFC react but don‚Äôt prevent
Reduced GPU utilization	Delays in RDMA completion stall gradient sync, reducing training efficiency
üß† Why DLB Is Needed ‚Äî Complements, Not Replaces
üîπ DLB = Proactive Congestion Avoidance
Feature	DLB Adds
Real-time path awareness	Dynamically chooses underutilized links based on congestion state (buffer, ECN, link usage)
Fine-grained control	Flowlet or flow-based rerouting to avoid hot spots
Congestion balancing	Even if PFC + ECN are working, DLB ensures traffic doesn‚Äôt pile up on one path
End-to-end utilization	Keeps Clos fabric evenly loaded, preventing bottlenecks in multi-hop paths
üîÅ Analogy:
PFC = Airbags ‚Üí Prevent damage when crash occurs (loss prevention).

ECN = Brake warning system ‚Üí Slow down if you're too close (reactive congestion control).

DLB = Waze-style dynamic routing ‚Üí Take a different road before traffic hits.

‚úÖ Conclusion:
Layer	Need	Why
PFC	Yes	Prevent in-switch packet loss for RDMA
ECN	Yes	Signal congestion early, reduce flow rate
DLB	‚úÖ Absolutely	Avoid congestion before it builds up, balance traffic across the fabric
In modern AI fabrics (like NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD or Arista AI Spine/Leaf fabrics), DLB is essential for maximizing performance and maintaining lossless behavior under real-world loads.

Yes, the 6WIND software stack can run on NVIDIA BlueField SmartNICs. 6WIND has demonstrated its virtual security gateway (vSecGW) operating on BlueField-2 DPUs, achieving scalable IPsec performance of at least 25 Gbps by leveraging DPU hardware offloading. ‚Äã

This integration allows service providers to offload networking and security functions from the host CPU to the DPU, enhancing performance and efficiency. Additionally, 6WIND's Virtual Service Routers (VSR) support deployment across NVIDIA platforms, including BlueField DPUs. ‚Äã

For optimal performance, it's recommended to utilize the NVIDIA DOCA SDK, which provides tools and libraries tailored for developing applications on BlueField DPUs. This ensures seamless integration and maximizes the benefits of hardware acceleration offered by the BlueField architecture.‚Äã



Tacc provides a framework which forms the basis of a state sharing model in EOS (AID65). Sysdb being the central agent where the entire state is stored and EOS agents have the proxy copies of the state. Any create/update/deletes to the state made by an agent is propagated and synchronized across the system through the underlying framework. 

Sysdb is the same as any other EOS agent which has minimal user code and consists entirely of TACC-generated code plus framework code. With that, and with it only maintaining state and no real application processing (mostly true - though there are agent specific reactors which execute in Sysdb's context), the agent is expected to be robust for software reasons. In this way, it is like a conventional file system, protecting the state and providing access to it, yet not running any application-specific code. To summarize, Sysdb is basically an hierarchical object store (similar to that of a file system) that provides real-time access, updates and notification of updates. Agents can subscribe to specific paths and either push updates to those paths or receive notifications when something at that path changes by mounting that specific path. AttrLog (or attribute logging) is the mechanism and protocol by which the state of the object in Sysdb and that of the proxy in the agent are kept up-to-date.


EOS agents ‚Äúmount‚Äù the state they are interested in from Sysdb. By term ‚Äúmounting‚Äù we mean creating a local proxy of the Sysdb state. A proxy can be created for read or read-write based on the mount flags. Any updates made to these proxy objects within an agent causes the updated data to be ‚Äúwritten‚Äù to Sysdb, which in turn will propagate the update to the other agents. The ‚Äúproxy‚Äù object in the agent and the real object in Sysdb are always kept in sync once mounted.

 an attribute `enabled` (fullname: /ar/Sysdb/route/config.enabled), the path /ar/Sysdb/route/config.enabled is not a mountpoint.

All paths created via preinit profiles are considered mountpoints because they represent whole entities or Tac::Dirs containing other entities.

(see Tac::Dir internals for more info on how entities are stored in a Tac::Dir)

In general, MountPoint(s) can be created statically or dynamically:
"Static" MountPoint(s) are created by Sysdb when it processes the preinit profiles before any agents connect to Sysdb. All the paths in all preinit files are considered static MountPoint(s)
‚ÄúDynamic‚Äù MountPoint(s) are created when agents create an entity in a Tac::Dir or if the SysdbMountProfile for an agent lists a given path with a ‚Äúc‚Äù flag
EntityManager
EntityManager is the common name used for a TACC object Sysdb::EntityManager and a python module Sysdb/EntityManager.py, both of which provide the ability to mount entities from Sysdb or other agents.

TBD: Create a document for EntityManager.
The comment at the top of EntityManger.py file explains how to use it

BGP unnumbered has become increasingly relevant in AI and high-performance data centers, particularly due to its ability to simplify routing and scale out modern, large-scale compute fabrics.

Here‚Äôs a focused breakdown of BGP unnumbered in AI data center use cases, including why it's attractive and how it helps:

üöÄ Why BGP Unnumbered?
BGP unnumbered allows IP routing over point-to-point links without assigning IP addresses to interfaces. It uses the router ID or loopback address as the BGP identifier, and the interface's link-local IPv6 address (or IPv4 link identifiers in RFC 5549) for next-hop resolution.

üîß Key Use Cases in AI Data Centers
1. Hyper-Scale Leaf-Spine Topology Simplification
In GPU-based clusters, hundreds to thousands of nodes are interconnected using leaf-spine or even dragonfly-like topologies.

Using BGP unnumbered removes the need to assign /30 or /31 subnets to every physical link.

Benefit: Reduces IP management overhead and speeds up provisioning of nodes and links.

2. Automated Fabric Bring-Up
With BGP unnumbered, fabric links can come up automatically with zero manual IP configuration.

Useful in liquid cooling rack units or GPU pods where racks or chassis are hot-plugged.

Benefit: Enables plug-and-play routing with minimal configuration.

3. Scalable Multi-Vendor Interop
Many AI clusters (e.g., NVIDIA DGX pods, Meta Research clusters) use heterogeneous switches (Arista, Cisco, NVIDIA/Mellanox).

BGP unnumbered is supported across vendors using RFC 5549 (IPv4 NLRI with IPv6 next-hops).

Benefit: Vendor-neutral and simplifies cross-platform deployments.

4. Overlay/Underlay Separation for NVLink or RoCE
BGP unnumbered is used in underlay to provide L3 connectivity, while overlays (e.g., VXLAN-EVPN) run on top.

Useful when RoCEv2 is used alongside regular IP networking.

Benefit: Clean separation of control planes and better deterministic performance.

5. Stateless Infrastructure for ML/AI Workloads
BGP unnumbered supports declarative networking, making it compatible with tools like Ansible, NetBox, or Kubernetes-based controllers.

Ideal for containerized ML workloads that scale up/down frequently (e.g., Kubernetes + NVIDIA Triton).

Benefit: Stateless IP routing avoids the need to persist or track individual interface IPs.

üß† Typical Deployment Workflow
Loopback IPs configured and used as BGP Router IDs

Interfaces have no IP addresses

Routing information exchanged using BGP with neighbor interface <interface> on Arista/Cisco/FRRouting

BGP next-hop resolution handled via link-local addresses

üîç Example: NVIDIA DGX POD with Arista Spine-Leaf
Leaf switches: Arista DCS-7050X3

Spine switches: Arista 7280R or 7800R

DGX servers: Use SR-IOV or BlueField SmartNIC with BGP unnumbered to announce routes to loopback services (e.g., gRPC inference service IP)

EVPN overlays on top for service discovery

üì¶ Related Tech

  ipv6 unnumbered lo<-------borrows IP address from loopback

BGP: exchanges capabilities during Open message, before established
Idle ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Active ‚Üí OpenSent ‚Üí OpenConfirm ‚Üí Established

Yes, if a BGP speaker sends an OPEN message with RFC 5549 (IPv4 NLRI with IPv6 next-hop) capability and the peer does not support it (i.e., does not include it in its own OPEN capabilities), then no routes using that capability will be exchanged, but a BGP Notification is not sent by default unless the peer is strict about capability matching.

‚ÄúIf a BGP speaker receives an UPDATE message that contains the MP_REACH_NLRI or MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute and it has not advertised the capability to receive the particular AFI/SAFI, the UPDATE message MUST be ignored.‚Äù

Complex congestion control: needs ECN + RCM for fairness and avoidance of head-of-line blocking.

Interoperability: Requires compatible RDMA-capable NICs (e.g., NVIDIA/Mellanox, Broadcom, Intel)

üß™ Typical Use Cases
High-performance computing (HPC)

Distributed databases (e.g., Oracle RAC)

AI/ML clusters (e.g., GPU communication)

EOS:
 achieves this with a unique multi-process state sharing architecture that completely separates networking state from the processing itself.
 The key to EOS benefits is its unique multi-process state-sharing architecture that consists of multiple process agents interacting with a central shared state depository called SysDB.
 All state is held in sysdb.  Sysdb is an address space that purely holds state and delivers state updates from one agent to another.  For example, when a link goes down, a port driver updates the link state in sysdb, which delivers the update to the SNMP service, which then sends a trap.  By separating state from processing, the system can recover from a failure of a processing agent (such as the SNMP service) without impacting the switch‚Äôs operation other than SNMP itself.‚Ä®

Processing is in user space.  Protocol operation, management function, and device management, including hardware device drivers, run in user address spaces, not in the kernel.  By keeping the vast majority of processing out of the kernel, system stability is enhanced, and extensibility is simplified, because adding a new user process to UNIX is much simpler than adding a kernel-level process.







1. What is RoCEv2 and how is it different from RoCEv1?	RoCEv2 encapsulates RDMA over UDP/IP (Layer 3), while RoCEv1 uses Ethernet (Layer 2) and is not routable.
2. Why does RoCEv2 need a lossless network?	RDMA does not tolerate packet loss; packet drops lead to retransmissions at the app/NIC level, hurting latency and throughput.
3. What mechanisms are used to make Ethernet lossless?	Priority Flow Control (PFC), Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), and proper buffer tuning.
4. What is Priority Flow Control (PFC)?	IEEE 802.1Qbb mechanism that pauses traffic per priority class to prevent buffer overflows and drops.
5. How is RoCEv2 traffic typically classified and queued?	Using DSCP or 802.1p markings; usually assigned to a dedicated traffic class (e.g., priority 3).
6. How does ECN work in RoCEv2?	Congested switches mark ECN bits in IP headers; NICs adjust sending rate using RoCE Congestion Management (RCM).
7. What is RCM (RoCE Congestion Management)?	A congestion control mechanism that reacts to ECN marks by throttling traffic, supported mostly by NICs like ConnectX.
8. How do you configure PFC on Arista EOS?	Use priority-flow-control priority X enable under interface config.
9. How is buffer allocation important in RoCEv2 networks?	Under-provisioned buffers cause PFC storms or drops; static/dynamic buffers must be tuned per queue.
10. What challenges exist with PFC?	PFC head-of-line blocking, misconfiguration, or storms can impact non-RDMA traffic.
11. How does SONiC support RoCEv2?	Through buffer tuning, PFC, ECN/WRED, and QoS configuration using JSON profiles and switch CLI.
12. How would you debug RDMA packet drops in a RoCEv2 network?	Inspect PFC stats, ECN counters, NIC logs, switch queue drops, and ensure buffer profiles are sufficient.
13. What is the UDP port used for RoCEv2?	4791.
14. Can RoCEv2 be used across subnets?	Yes, since it is routable over IP.
15. How does RoCEv2 compare with iWARP and InfiniBand?	RoCEv2 has lower latency than iWARP and can leverage Ethernet infrastructure unlike InfiniBand.

There are a lot of similarities due to upstream/downstream relationships between these distros. The biggest difference is in the lifecycle.

Fedora has a new major version every six months, and each major version is maintained for about thirteen months. It does not have minor versions.

CentOS has a new major version every three years, and each major version is maintained for about five and half years. It does not have minor versions. It is based on Fedora.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) also has a new major version every three years, offset about six months after CentOS, which it is based on. Each major version is maintained for up to fourteen years, although the primary lifecycle is just ten years. Each major version gets new minor versions every six months. The minor version lifecycle is primarily six months, but select minor versions get maintained for up to four years, providing a nice overlap for environments that are the most sensitive to changes.

Alma is is also based on CentOS. It matches the primary RHEL lifecycles of ten years for major versions and six months for minor versions. Notably it lacks the overlapping minor version lifecycles that RHEL has.

Besides the lifecycle differences, these distros have different goals as well.

Fedora focuses on innovation and integration. It takes tens of thousands of upstream projects and combines them into an operating system. The fast major version cadence provides regular opportunities to incorporate the latest and greatest upstream software.

CentOS is the reference implementation of "Enterprise Linux", and defines what RHEL compatibility means. Each major version is the mainline for the corresponding RHEL major verison. It has to stay compatible within major versions because it defines future RHEL minor versions, which have product guarantees. It is also the main contribution and collaboration point for all downstream distros that claim RHEL compatibility.

RHEL minor versions branch off from CentOS and get various certifications. Third party hardware and software vendors also target RHEL minor versions for their products, sometimes going as far as to only support those minor versions that get the extra years of maintenance.

Alma aims to leverage the RHEL hardware/software ecosystem by matching RHEL minor versions closely. It lacks the certifications that RHEL offers.


EVPN:
Its new AFI/SAFI(25/70) that BGP-VPN supports, and defines route types
2,3,5.
Dataplane for EVPN can be two types. MPLS or VXLAN.
Its determined by Extended-Community 'Tunnel Encap ': VXLAN or MPLS
Based on this value in the received BGP update's NLRI, we interpret Label/VNI files as either MPLS Label vs VXLAN VNI.
Traditional MPLS-VPN only supports MPLS data-plane, and its only L3 service. But EVPN supports both L2 and L3 Service.

Where will be the EVPN route in BGP update message ?.

Its part of the attribute type: MP_REACH_NLRI, or MP_UNREACH_NLRI(to withdraw).
MP_REACH_NLRI:
flags,
Type(MP_REACH_NRI)
Length:
AFI=25,SAFI=70
NextHopAddress: <--------Note In case if IPv6NH(RFC5549(also called unnumbered BGP!!)) this will be an IPv6 address
route-type (Type 1,2,3,4)
route-length:
route-type-specific-fields
Type-2 Host Advertisement Route
Type-5 IP Prefix
Type-3 Advertiing Flood list for vlan(IMET: Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag)
Its used to control BUM traffic domain

Type-4 :Ethernet Segment Route: For Designated Forwarder

EVPN extended L2 Broadcast domain over L3 Network


TLS (Transport Layer Security)
Purpose: Secures data in transit via encryption and authentication.

Layer: Transport Layer (between TCP and application)

Used In: HTTPS, gRPC, SMTP, IMAP, etc.

Core Features:

Encryption: Ensures privacy

Authentication: Validates peer identity (via certificates)

Integrity: Detects tampering via MAC

TLS 1.3: Improved speed and security; eliminates many legacy vulnerabilities.

IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)
Purpose: Provides encryption, authentication, and integrity at the IP layer (L3).

Modes:

Transport Mode: Protects only the payload (end-to-end)

Tunnel Mode: Encrypts full IP packet (common in VPNs)

Protocols:

AH (Authentication Header): Auth only

ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload): Encrypt + Auth

Use Case: Site-to-site or remote-access VPNs; secure IP traffic regardless of application.





Sonic:
docker ps,
//Shows the description xml file of the docker including the networkID 
docker inspect
Note that two docker container can talk to each other if the networkID of both are same.
How to check this?.
First go into swss container  like below,then use ps -ef command see what are the process running
docker exec -ti swss bash
ps -ef

Use this command, start stop agents within the container,
supervisorctl

supervisor>restart vlanagent

Every container has 'supervisor' process running which signals the command that is
sent via supervisorctl command line. All containers have this supervisor process running
If a single container dies, all containers will be restarted by the monitoring process.

E.g how to look at the service configuration of a process in Linux
systemctl status snmp
It gives file /etc/systemd/system/snmp.service.d
This file has all the control variables and dependancies.

There is no acons equivalent in sonic.
/var/log> grep syncd syslog
You can enable syslog, by using swss cli command , which genereate syslogs, thatis one way to inspect an agent
but far less useful compared to acons
These are directory where respective container syslogs are stored
/var/log/frr
/var/log/swss

arcagent


redis-dump -d 4 -y | grep LOGGER
redis-dump -d 4 --pretty 
sonic-db-cli CONFIG_DB 

is available from linux prompt:
show ip interface


'monitor' tool is usefull to see interfce/socket etc


n SONiC, the config_db is stored as a JSON file at /etc/sonic/config_db.json. This file contains the startup configuration, which is then loaded into Redis during bootup. The content in Redis is considered the running configuration. 
redis-cli , give access to database
use SQL commands to get /set etc
redis-cli> select 0




;:1. Protocol Buffers, JSON & gRPC
‚úÖ Protobuf vs JSON:

Protobuf (Protocol Buffers):

Developed by Google.

Binary format ‚Üí smaller, faster, and more efficient.

Language-neutral, platform-independent.

Schema-based: requires .proto definitions.

JSON:

Human-readable text format.

Larger payloads, slower parsing.

Schema-less, flexible but less strict.

‚úÖ gRPC Overview:

Open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework by Google.

Uses Protobuf for serialization (binary format).

Transports over HTTP/2 (supports multiplexing, streaming, header compression).

gRPC Client ‚Üî gRPC Server communicate using defined service contracts.

‚úÖ Key Characteristics:

High performance (claims up to 5x faster than JSON/REST).

Ideal for inter-microservice communication (e.g., internal backend systems).

Poor native browser support ‚Üí gRPC-Web exists but still maturing.

Web clients need additional proxies (e.g., Envoy) for translation.

2. Kubernetes (K8s) Core Components
Control Plane:

API Server: Central gateway for all Kubernetes requests.

etcd: Distributed key-value store for config/state (high availability and persistence).

Scheduler: Assigns Pods to nodes based on resource constraints and policies.

Controller Manager: Watches API Server for state changes (e.g., ReplicationController ensures desired Pod count).

Worker Node:

kubelet: Node agent that communicates with API server, runs containers via CRI (e.g., containerd).

kube-proxy: Maintains network rules for Pod communication (iptables or IPVS based).

‚úÖ K8s Features:

Highly scalable, supports auto-scaling, service discovery, and self-healing.

Runs on hybrid cloud, public cloud, or on-premises.

Supports container orchestration across thousands of nodes.

‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks:

Complex to set up and manage (requires DevOps expertise).

High initial cost (infrastructure, tooling, and manpower).

Operational overhead for upgrades, monitoring, security, and networking.
