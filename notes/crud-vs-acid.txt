CRUD stands for:

Create â€“ Insert new data

Read â€“ Retrieve data

Update â€“ Modify existing data

Delete â€“ Remove data

Characteristics:
Operation-centric.

Maps directly to SQL commands: INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE.

Often used in REST APIs and simple data manipulation systems.

Stateless: Each operation is independent.

No built-in concept of atomicity, consistency, isolation, or durability (ACID).

Use Cases:
Web apps (basic RESTful services).

Admin dashboards, content management systems.

Systems where operations don't need to span multiple resources.

ðŸ”¹ Transaction-Based Model
A transaction is a logical unit of work that must be atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID).

Characteristics:
Enforces atomicity: all operations succeed or none do.

Ensures data integrity even in complex or concurrent environments.

Manages concurrency via locks or MVCC.

Supports rollback and commit semantics.

Ideal for multi-step, interdependent operations.

Use Cases:
Banking and financial systems.

E-commerce checkout flows.

Distributed systems (via distributed transactions).

Systems that need strong consistency.
