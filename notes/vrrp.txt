What is VRRP?
VRRP (RFC 5798) is a Layer 3 redundancy protocol that allows multiple routers to work together to present a single virtual default gateway IP address to end hosts. If the primary router fails, one of the backups takes over seamlessly, ensuring continuous gateway availability.

🧩 Core Components
Virtual IP (VIP): Shared IP used as default gateway by clients.

Master Router: The router currently forwarding traffic for the VIP.

Backup Routers: Monitors master and takes over if it fails.

VRID (Virtual Router ID): Identifies the VRRP group.

Priority: Higher number = higher chance to become master (default master = priority 255).

🏢 VRRP in Data Center Deployments
✅ Typical Use Case:
L2/L3 boundary (ToR or aggregation layer)

Provides gateway redundancy for:

Bare-metal servers

Hypervisors (KVM, ESXi)

Leaf-spine fabrics with VLANs or VRFs

📦 Deployment Models
1. Active-Passive ToR Setup
Two Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches share a VIP.

One ToR is VRRP master, the other backup.

End-hosts (e.g., servers) use the VIP as default gateway.

2. Layer 3 Leaf-Spine
VRRP may be used on leaf switches to offer redundancy to compute nodes.

Spine switches usually run pure L3 ECMP and don't need VRRP.

3. Mixed Fabric (Overlay Underlay)
VRRP may provide gateway redundancy at overlay edge (VXLAN VTEP) or at the border leaf.

📡 How It Works
Master sends periodic advertisements (default 1s).

Backup listens; if it misses 3 consecutive advertisements, it promotes itself.

Failover time: ~3 seconds (tunable using timers for faster failover).

Gratuitous ARP is sent on failover to update MAC-to-IP mappings.

⚙️ Key Configuration Parameters
vrrp <group-id>

priority <1-254> (255 = master)

advertisement-interval

preempt (whether backup takes over if it becomes higher priority)

🔍 VRRP vs Alternatives
Protocol	Use Case	Notes
VRRP	L3 gateway redundancy	Vendor-neutral, easy to deploy
HSRP	Cisco environments	Cisco proprietary
GLBP	Load-sharing gateway	Cisco proprietary, multi-active
EVPN GW	Overlay gateway (VXLAN)	Uses anycast gateways (MAC+IP)
⚠️ Limitations in Modern DCs
Active-passive only: No load sharing (unless using multiple groups).

State sync: No session/stateful failover like firewall pairs.

Not ideal for EVPN-VXLAN with anycast gateway (use BGP EVPN instead)

🔧 Example (Cisco-like)
bash
Copy
Edit
interface Vlan100
 ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 vrrp 1 ip 192.168.1.1
 vrrp 1 priority 150
 vrrp 1 preempt
🚀 Summary
Feature	VRRP in DC Context
Purpose	L3 gateway redundancy
Best Fit	Small/medium deployments, edge VLANs
Failover Time	~3 sec (customizable)
Load Sharing	Not native (multiple groups possible)
EVPN Compatibility	Replaced by Anycast Gateway in EVP
