What is TLS/SSL termination ?

A TLS termination proxy (or SSL termination proxy[1], or SSL offloading[2]) is a proxy server that is used
by an institution to handle incoming TLS connections, decrypting the TLS and passing on the unencrypted
request to the institution's other servers (it is assumed that the institution's own network is secure
so the user's session data does not need to be encrypted on that part of the link).
TLS termination proxies are used to reduce the load on the main servers by offloading the
cryptographic processing to another machine, and to support servers that do not support SSL, like Varnish.

SSL and TLS:
TLS is newer version of SSL, and it more secure.
Which layer it belongs to ?:
Application Layer or Presentation (encryption/decription), or session layer.
All are true.
If the Handshake involves : TCP then its fair to say (application layer protocol.

How SSL/TLS session connection is established?.
client(browser) <------------->server(tomcat/apache)
1. Client send list of supported SSL/TLS version and suported encryption  to server->
2. Server sends Digital Certificate(CA) and Public Key in response to it.
3. Client verifies this data via outside (Certificate Autority) to confirm authenticty of the webserver.
4. Client now trusts Servera and sends its data with shared secret encrypted with Servers Public Key.
5. Cliet sends Finished message, indicate client part of handshake is complete.
6. Server Responds with its Fiished message.

Now client/server exchange symmetrically encrypted data with shared secret key.

What are some important port number

TCP vs UDP.
Both are Transport Layer protocols
TCP : 20 byte header, stream based/reliable/connection-based .
Connection is established using 3 way hand shake(TX SYN,RX SYN-ACK, TX ACK).
Connection is tear down is also done via handshake.
This is the reason why TCP is called connection oriented.
In-order delivery, receiver ACKS every packets received, client expects ACK.
Segments are numbered.
Delays Tx when network is congested.
Splits data into smaller chunks if N/S is congested, and re-assembles.

TCP uses a congestion window in the sender side to do congestion avoidance.
The congestion window indicates the maximum amount of data that can be sent
out on a connection without being acknowledged. TCP detects congestion when
it fails to receive an acknowledgement for a packet within the estimated timeout.

TCP 3 way hand shake shown in the picture with 3 steps:

Client A---------------------------------Server B
1. SYN (Seq#100, Ack#0, Syn#1  SYN request)-------->
2. SYN-ACK        <--------------------(Seq#200, Ack#101, Syn#1  SYN reply)
3. ACK (Seq#101 Ack#201, Syn#0  ACK)------->

Note Ack field is used to fill sequeunce number of sender,
Note Seq# is always filled by originator to indicate his current running seq number.
Note Syn# field is used to request synchronization
Note that Ack field always increment value by one of the received Seq before replying.

UDP: 8byte packet header, connection less,message based, order not guaranteed, no-handshakes, 
     no congestion control, good for SNMP, HD-Video etc.
     Sending of UDP packet does not need a prior session established, nor an ACK is
     expected after send and receive.
     Meaning, there must be a listener on the server at port e.g for SNMP 161.
     Client sends packet to that server. Server uses clients source port to reply
     e.g SNMP querry reply.

Some commonly used port numbers used at transport layers.
22  SSH
23  TELNET
53  DNS
80  HTTP
443 HTTPS(over SSL/TLS)
161 SNMP


VXLAN: 
VTEP Virtual Tunnel End Point.(Adds 50byte overhead in L3 network) for every packet.
Original 'L2' frame(e.g ARP request, or unknown MAC's are) are embedded into UDP packet with
8byte VXLAN header and sent to multicast group on the IP transport. This enables learning
of SMAC by each VTEP, including inner 'SMAC'. (HOSTMAC,VTEPIP,VTEPMAC,SEGMENTID) 
=======================================================================================
HOST-MAC1---VETP1---Shared Transport Network(IP and Multicast)----VTEP2---HOST-MAC2.
          ->ENCAP-> + 50 bytes                                      DECAP ->-50bytes
      ----->MAC1 Entry(ARP-Request)                               MAC1 Entry
            MAC2 Entry                                            MAC2 Entry(ARP-Reply) <----
=======================================================================================           
Note: After discovery of destination mac address(using ARP), VTEP's forwarding table
is used to forward HOST packets(still embeded in UDP/VXLANHDR) to destination VTEP, and then to destination HOST.

MC-LAG: Multi Chassis LAG,
https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/9868751/asr9000xr-multichassis-lag-or-mc-lag-mclag-guide
Multichassis LAG is a tricky concept. In general the members of a bundle (also called LAG, Link Aggregation Group, Etherchannel, Portchannel) are between 2 distinct devices. The advantage of using a bundle is that there is a single routing peering, no worries about spanning tree and things like that. However the redundancy is compromised when either one of the peers fail. Using ECMP (Equal Cost Multipath) in L3 scenarios allows me to dual home to 2 different devices so I have a back up also when one of the peers fail for me, but that negates the benefit of using bundle having a single routing peering.

MC-LAG attempts to provide a means to allow me to dual home a device (DHD, the dual homed device) to two different peer devices (the POA, or Point of Attachment), so basically allowing me to have the benefits of node redundancy, while maintaining single peerings which makes my L2 (Spanning Tree/ STP) or L3 (no dual peerings) life a lot easier.


DHD : Dual Homed Device,Operates as-if its connected to single virtual device using LACP.
ICC : Inter chassis Communication Protocol, to sync state and form a Redundancy Group. 
      This link also helps redirect traffic to appropriate(backup PE) to meet SPF requirement.
      Watch the video link to get more details.
POA :Point of Attachment, they same System MAC address and System Priority when communicating
    with DHD.

VRRP:
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol:
VRRP instance is limited to single subnet, it does not advertise subnets beyond that subnet
or affect the routing table in anyway.
An instance is idenitified by instance ID , which can range from 1 to 255.

VRRP instance creates a 'virtual router' with unique IP address(Gateway address) or VIP
that hosts(users) will know as. 'Virtual Router' is made of an 'active' and 'slave' physical router.
State is elected based on vrrp priority and other elements like who starts advertising first.

Both routers use same unique MAC address for VIP address on there virtual NIC, e.g 01.00.5E.00.01.xx.
xx is the VRRP ID.  This mac is used for ARP reply by primary node,
Other node will not reply, thats how it attracts active traffic from clients  for forwarding.
VRRP periodic advertisements are sent over a well known multicast address  e.g 224.0.0.18, so
recepient must have 'IGMP snooping' enabled to process these.

Physical routers within the 'virtual router' group must communicate with each other on a well
known multicast IP address 224.0.0.18, Using the 'priority' a router with highest priority will become master.
Failure to receive multi-cast IP packet(vrrp hello) from master,
triggers switch, and slave will become master.
Only Master sends IP multicast packets periodically.
All of these routers must be in the same LAN segment.

Linux has interface dependancy(master) , this is used while creating a VRRP VIP interface.


e.g R1 (PIP1, VIP)    ------R2(PIP1, VIP)
PIP1,2 Primary IP interface(Usually a physical interface).
VIP Virtual IP interface(Usually latches on the PIP in that router).
Note that PIP should always be UP on both sides, as clients when using VIP do not
send traffic directly to PIP address. Clients are not blocked from
sending traffic directly to PIP address, but redunancy is not guaranteed.

All PIP1, PIP2, and VIP must belong to same subnet.

SNORT: is an open source network intrusion prevention and detection system (IDS/IPS) developed by Sourcefire. 
Combining the benefits of signature, protocol, and anomaly-based inspection, 
Snort is the most widely deployed IDS/IPS technology worldwide.
Main Components:
Packet Decoder : Takes pkts from different types of network interfaces(Eth,PPP, etc) for preprocessing
Preprocessor: 
1. Prepare data for detection engine
2. detect anomalies in packet headers
3. packet defragmentation
4. decode HTTP URI
5. Reassemble TCP streams.

Detection Engine: Applies Rules to packet.
Reads 'rules' if matched an alert is generated.
string matching algorithm 'Boyer-Moore' is used.
Logging and Alerting System:
Output Module:
Rules:
'Rule Header' + 'Rule Options'
e.g 'Action log,
     protocol tcp
     sip      10.10.10.1
     direction :
     sport, dip,dport
     'msg detected' < --Rule Options
==========================================================================================================
ARP(Address Resolution Protocol):

ATNDP(Application, Transport, Network, Data-link(2), Physical)
L2, data-link layer prototocol
L2HDR + L2Payload(SMAC, SIP, TARGETMAC, TARGETIP)

IP packets are always encapsulated in Ethernet Header(with DMAC and SMAC) on the wire.
Meaning, to send and IP packet to say a destination D, you must know D's (Router)MAC address also.
What ARP protocls does it send 'ARP Request(broadcast messsage)'
asking for MAC-address, given an IP address.

ARP Reply(unicast to sender of ARP Request) with a MAC address. Results are store in 'ARP Cache'
This is done dynamically on a need basis(say e.g ping to D, firt ARP query is sent).
ARP Cache is queried first, to find D's mac address.

ICMP ping before sending IP packet to destination must know the mac address of the destination
IP. It finds this by looking at local ARP table. If not found, it sends ARP request.

The interface on the remote router/host which has this IP configured replies to this ARP request
saying that my MAC and IP bindings are here. Thus ARP table is updated, and ICMP pings
can be sent out.

We can flush /clear ARP table, In that case, ping like applications resend ARP requests to relearn.

Proxy ARP: Its a feature on 'Routers', wherein they respond to an 'ARP Reuest' for an
'Target IP' address for which they are not the owners.
They do this, because there routinging table knows how to route IP packets with
that destination D to the next hop if its received by this router with DMAC equal to its own MAC.

Gratuitous ARP?.
When Sending-IP and Target-Ip in a 'ARP Request' is same it s called a Gratuitous ARP.
This is done for : a. Host Registration, b. Duplicate IP deletion.
If there is an 'ARP Reply' for this message, it means, there is a duplicate address
exist in the network.

Example ARP , ICMP, Routing, Switching , packet flow:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqXuHMBwN88&list=LL

(10.1.1.1/24)H1---------Switch1----(10.1.1.2/24)R1(30.1.1.2/24)------(30.1.1.3/24)R2(20.1.1.2/24)----Switch2-----H2(20.1.1.1)
                                          20.1.1.0/24->NH 30.1.1.2
    ARP-Rq(10.1.1.2)                      ARP-Rq(30.1.1.3)                         ARP-Rq(20.1.1.1) 
ping 20.1.1.1
1.H1 first looks at the IP, and it does not belong to its own network,
  so it routes the ICMP ping request.
  Since its not a router, it sends to its default gateway(10.1.1.2) 
  Before sending, it looks for MAC address for 10.1.1.2, so ARP request is sent
2. Switch1 will broadcast this ARP request(as DMAC is FFFF),  so R1 receives this ARP request
   R1. looks at ARP packet, and IP address in it, which belongs to itself, so it replies to this
   by sending out ARP Reply(unicast DMAC of H1) is used.
   Switch1 forwards this to H1.
3. H1 now sends ICMP echo request, with DIP20.1.1.1, SIP 10.1.1.1, DMAC(R1 mac) ,
   R1 receives it, looks for 20.1.1.1, finds its routing entry and NH is 30.1.1.3,
   which it needs to resolve ARP, so sends ARP request towards R2,
4. R2 replies for ARP questest, R1 receives the MAC address of R2,
   R1 now routes the ICMP Echo request to R2 with DMAC of R2.
5. R2 now looks at ICMP Echo request, and looks for DIP 20.1.1.1.
   Sends ARP request towards Switch2, to resovle MAC address of 20.1.1.1.
6. H2 sends ARP Reply, so R2 learns MAC address of H2, 
   R2 now routes the packet to H2 with DMAC of H2.
7. H2 receives this, looks at ICMP ping, and its DIP is same as ping request,
   It will generate ICMP Echo Reply, with DIP 10.1.1.1.
8. H2 will have MAC address for Default gateway 20.1.1.2 via 
   previous ARP-Rq received, so it sends ICMP reply with DMAC of R2.
9. R2 will route this packet towards 10.1.1.1, with NH 30.1.1.1 
   It already have MAC address of R1, 

10.R1 will recieved this, and will have MAC address of H1 10.1.1.1

Important:
H1 will never learn MAC address of H2, as ICMP reply have MAC address of R1.
Switches do not replace, or modify MAC address when forwards any packet.
ICMP request has a fixed DIP and SIP throughout ping process.
But, DMAC keeps changing based on where it has to go.
But, SMAC keesp changing based on who sends out(In Router only)

MAC Address Basic:
A multicast MAC address will have LSBit set to 1 of the MSByte.
Sizeof MAC address is 6bytes, or 48bits, 3MSByte's form OUI
Generally represented with 4 group of numbers 01:02:03:04:05:06
etype:  Value of less than or equal 1500 represents the length of the frame.
        These are 802.3 type of frames.(e.g STP/RSTP frames)

        Value of greater than 1500, represents 'Ether Type' and these are Ethernet II frames.
	etype seperates 'data link layer' with 'network layer'.

etype=0x8100 :indicates a presense of 802.1q header(2 byte = 12bit vlan, 3bit .1q priority) after etype.
              Its called VLAN tag.

etype=0x88ab : 802.1ad   q-in-q  : double tagged
Note that after the above etype, 2bytes are used to reprsent vlan, after vlan, again 'etype' field is there
to repsent the etype of the payload(packet) this tagged packet carrying.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1ad#/media/File:TCPIP_802.1ad_DoubleTag.svg

etype=0x8847 : indicates a presense of MPLS LABLE after etype.
               MPLS header is 4byte label stack, each label has 20bit label,(TTL, S< EXP bit etc)
etype=0x0800 : (IPv4) packet.

              'Protocol == 47' represents 'GRE'(Meaning after IP header, we see 8byte GRE header
               GRE= Generic Routing Encapsulation, is a tunneling protocol.


Important
802.1p method is a Quality of Service (QoS) process defined within the IEEE 802.1Q standard.
The technique uses a three-bit field within an Ethernet frame header to assign priority levels to packets moving within a network segment. 
With the technique, this priority value is used to differentiate traffic. IEEE 802.1p specifies 
traffic prioritization at Layer 2 of the OSI model. 802.1p traffic priorities are included 
in the Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) tags. Devices on a network that complies with the 802.1p 
signalling standard can classify data traffic into priority classes. When network 
congestion occurs, higher priority packets are transmitted before lower priority data.
=======================================================================================
LLDP: Link Layer Discovery Protocol (similar to Cisco Discovery Protocol)
Device advertise about there identity using LLDP PDU tx at set interval.
Its not two way,or ACK based.
DMAC is wellknown multicast address
ChassisID, PortID, Time-To-Live
This is advertisement only protocol.
These packets are never forwarded, meaning, that only directly connected devices are known to NBRS.

In case of OpenFlow Switch, they break this rule, and forward these LLDP packets.
(in this case it uses a different Multicast MAC addressto not interfere with regular LLDP message). 
This is called OLDP proto(not official).
========================================================================================

IPv6:
Each address is of size 16 byte, or, 128bits. mask can be up to /128
Note IPv4 is 4 bytes long with 32bits width, meaning IPv6 is 4 times bigger in size.

4 MSB Bytes form 'network prefix'
4 LSB Byte identifies Intf ID/MAC of the device if choosen.
Represented as 8 chunks of 2 bytes seperated by colon.
Each chunk represent 2 byte, represented in 4 char hex.

When a chunk has zero value it can be skipped(via :: notation).
2001:db8:49:0:ab00:0:0:102 => 2001:db8:49:0:ab00::102<----two zeros are skipped here
Note the zeros between 49 and ab are not compresses.<-----very important
Only leading zeros are compressed.

IPSec: IPv6 mandates use of IPsec, which is not the case of IPv4.
Because of increased addres space, NAT is not needed.<-----very important.
So its easier to troubleshoot IPv6 networks.(but link-local address is generated automatically,
and make this dynamic value bit harder in routing protocol to remember and use as NH.
etype 0x86DD is used to distinguish at link-layer,
      0x800 for IPv4.

TTL is renamed as HOPLIMIT.
Header Checksum field is not there.
FlowLabel field is added.
What is link-layer address in IPV6 ?.

What is Neighbor Discovery Protocol?
 Its equivalent of ARP used in IPv4. So its only designed
 for mac discovery(link-layer) given an IPv6 address.

 Mainly it uses ICMPv6 packets.
 Different Message types of ND
 ============================
 Msg between two host:
 NS Neighbor Solicitation: To check if NBR is still reachable,
 It will have request like what is your MAC, given IPv6 adress.
 It also has a special multcast destination address,
 
 NR Neighbor Reply
 Confirms that it has MAC address for IPv6 address.


 Routers register for different multicast mac address for NDP to work
 and they have better role.
 RS Router Solicitation (multicast DST) sent to Router from host
 RR Router Reply sent from Routr to host
 RA Router advertisement(multicast DST, ipv6 address the local link can use)

DHCPv6 ?.
Used for IPv6 global IP configuration.  ND helps discover DHCPv6 server.

What is DAD ?
Duplicate Address Detection.
Since all device in IPv6 interface must have self generated Link Local address.
Before it allocates, it send DAD message , and if no reply seen, it will assign the Ipv6 link local address .

ARP spoofing?.
Its a man-in-the-middle attack where, between server and client(victim)
someone sends ARP(reply) with clients IP address, thus attracting clients traffic dirctly to him self.
He first has to sniff traffic and get IP address of cliient. Use that address and send
Gratitus ARP with client-ip and attackers host MAC address.

IP Fragmentation and MTU:
When you join multile networks, MTU can vary. to address this issue, packet can be
fragmented to fit the size.
IPv4 header (Network Layer) has bits to support this. Typically framgmentation
is done based on destination outgoing interface of the packet before forwarding.
If outgiong MTU is 1500bytes, and packet is 2000bytes, packet is split into two fragment 1500 and 500 bytes
with same frament ID, so that they are identified at the destination so they get re-assembled.
There is a bit(flags) to indicate 'more framents' in IPv4 header, which helps identify end of framgneted pakets.
There is a bit(flags) to indicate 'dont fragment' (e.g ping to test the path with big size of packet, or pth MTU discovery)
Note that re-assembly of packets only happen at the destinatination.

What is MTU vs MSS?.
MSS is the Maxium Segment Size negotiated between a pair of TCP nodes to send and receives.
MSS value is payload value of the packet that TCP process can handle. 
MTU is always higher than MSS. On top of MSS size, Packet headr 20+20bytes is added to make it to MTU size.



=============================================
IPSec:
IPSec tunnel mode is used to protect site-to-site (gateway-to-gateway) traffic between networks, such as site-to-site networking through the Internet. The sending gateway encapsulates the entire IP datagram by adding a new IP header and then protects the new packet using one of the IPSec protocols.
AH : Authenticaion Header: 
The AH protocol provides data origin authentication, data integrity, and anti-replay protection for the entire packet (both the IP header and the data payload carried in the packet), except for the fields in the IP header that are allowed to change in transit. AH does not provide data confidentiality, which means that it does not encrypt the data. The data is readable, but protected from modification and spoofing.
ESP: Encapsulating Security Payload:
The ESP protocol provides data origin authentication, data integrity, anti-replay protection, and the option of confidentiality for the IP payload only. ESP in transport mode does not protect the entire packet with a cryptographic checksum nor does it protect the IP header.
=============================================
DNS:
DHCPv4:Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol:
1. Clients configured as DHCP clients during boot time request an IP address using
broadcast message DHCPDISCOVER(computer name, MACaddress).
2. DHCP Server sends DHCPOFFER(it has not IP address),
3. Client responds with DHCPREQUEST.
4. Server sends DHCPACK(has IP address) completing the process.
DHCPv6:
=======================================================================================
ICMP:Internet Control Message Protocol.
Its header starts after IPv4 header, with proto id 1.
with 8byte header and variable size data section.
Type 0 : is used for 'Echo Reply' for Ping
Type 8 : is used for 'Echo Request' for Ping.
Type 5 : 'Redirect Message' : Sent from source if there is better address on other router.
Type 3 :  Destination Unreachable (say TCP/UDP/ICMP port/transaction not reachable)
Type 11: Time Exceeded.(by Traceroute for TTL exceed)

=======================================================================================

NAT/CGNAT:
Its a way of replacing a source-ip and port with wellknow(public-ip)/ports before forwarding it to Internet.
NAT forwarding Table
Note that 12.13.14.15 is public address given by Service Provider for your DSL or Modem.

Device        PrivateSide(SIP)  / PublicSide(SIP)
===============================================
iphone        192.168.1.1:42301  12.13.14.15/24601
macbook       192.168.1.2:42302  12.13.14.15/24602
AppleTV       192.168.1.3:42303  12.13.14.15/24603

Essentially a network of many IP address(private) can be hidden behind , using
NAT forwarding table before sending, and when the reply is received, 'DIP/Port' are replaced from
this table.

This saves lots of IP addresses.

Device Behind      NAT Router 
NAT Router
Due to shortage of IPv4 addresses(4.5billion max IPv4),
===========================================================================================
Carrier-grade NAT (CGN), also known as large-scale NAT (LSN), is an approach to IPv4 network design in which end sites,
in particular residential networks, are configured with private network addresses that are translated to public
IPv4 addresses by middlebox network address translator devices embedded in the network operator's network,
permitting the sharing of small pools of public addresses among many end sites.
This shifts the NAT function and configuration thereof from the customer premises to the Internet service provider network.
DisAdvantage: Difficult host services, Makes it difficult for LawEnforcement to trace back, unless NAT tables are logged.
PortForwarding by end-user is difficult to implement.
Significant security, scalability and reliability issues.
===================================================================

DOS Attack: (Denial of Service):
Generally once a unique source attacks a system by sending unwanted junk packets.

Traffic Attack: Send huge volume of TCP/UDP and ICMP packet, during this
legitimate packets gets lost, so actual user will loose service.

Bandwidth Attacks: Overload with massive amount of junk data, resulting
into loss of bandwidth , can lead to complete denial of service.

Application Attacks: Application-layer data messages are sent.

DDOS Attack: Incoming bad traffic to the victim originates from
many different sources(often infected with Trojan) makeit it
hard for Victim to stop the attack.
