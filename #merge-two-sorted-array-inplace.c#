/*
 What is external sort ?.
 When you need to sort a large file say 20gig, 
 *its better to chunk the file into small pieces,
 * sort each chunk bring it into memory.
 * and send back to file.
 * at the end merge chunks one by one, at the end we have fully sorted file.

 * Merge two array sorted asending, into A, which has enough space
 * Trick: Since its in place merge, you can't overwrite A elements with B's.
 *        Reverse copy is the way to go for this case.
 * assume A has enough space and, merge into A, content of B
