Provisoning Baremetal server in any form factor, sitting in a datacenter via APIs possibly REST API.
To support this, a Baremetal server must support folling basic minimum h/w and software protocols:

e.g Raspberry Pi board:

Bare metal Network booting: How its done ?.
0. IPMI interfaces.
0. Some storage on the bord.

1. PXE/iPXE : Pre execute environment.
             iPXE is extended version or new version of the same.
2. DHCP : Providing IP dynamically
3. TFTP : provides intiaal file system
4. NFS : if you do not have the storage in your hw


Use case?.
1. Apply this to an already existing company data center (On Prem)
2. Data security, like bank do not like to use Public Clund
3. Latency, best performance is needed(last mile)

Challenges:
1. Difficult manually provision in a diffrent way. so its best to automate.
2. Increate of control comes with increase of complexity,
   e.g various flavors of OS, CPU types.

Tinkerbell is complete solution to address all of these:
Has these basic micro services
1. Tink : Provisioning and workflow engine, has a CLI
   Tink-Server : engine
   Tink-Worker: Runs on the Baremental it provision.
2. Boots : DHCP and iPXE server
3. Hegel : Metadata service
4. OSIE  : Installation Environment
5  PBnJ
